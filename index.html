					<h3>Valentine's Day Pups</h3>
					<p>Pawlina, a well-known south Texpaws beagle, has given birth to an astonishing litter of 18 puppies on Saturday, February 14th. This beats the previous record of 12 puppies set by her mother, Pawsephone. Since these puppies were born on Valentine's Day, they are all named after Valentine's Day traditions.</p>

			<p>While other puppies were hard at work in their junior year of puppyhood, this puppy celebrated his early graduation from the Puppy Academy. Tater Tot, a golden retriever, was the first of his litter to graduate. The graduation ceremony was held in the Puppy Academy's main hall, where all the puppies' parents and teachers were in attendance.</p>
			<p>Since Tater Tot graduated in the top 10% of his class, he was awarded a special graduation certificate and instant admission to a university of his choice. Tater Tot is now enrolled at the University of Texpaws at Dallas.</p>

			<h2>Beach Fun Beats Horror Movies</h2>

			<p>Instead of kicking back and watching horror movies, these puppies were determined to get their paws in the sand. The 20th annual Puppy Beach to Bay Run was held on Friday, February 13th. The marathon spanned five miles from Bark Beach to Bone Bay in south Texpaws.</p>
			<p>"Ruff ruff woof. Woof woof ruff" Pawl, a seasoned runner said. The event wasn't just for seasoned runners, it welcomed all from young to old— beginner to advanced.</p>
